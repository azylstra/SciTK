{"name":"Scitk","tagline":"Java GUI toolkit for analytic applications","body":"### Welcome to the SciTK website\r\n\r\nThis goal of this library is to greatly simplify writing basic scientific-type applications. The toolkit provides functionality for most of the user interface, allowing you to write an application that focuses on the analysis and offload GUI work to SciTK.\r\n\r\nPlots are created using the [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) library, and are wrapped into windows with functionality for editing or saving the plot. A few varieties of dialog are available for getting input from the user. Some GUI elements are implemented into a template main window which can be extended for simple applications.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Using the code\r\nThere is a simple example program included with the source. Look under the _example_ directory for a program which adds several buttons to the SciTK application window. These buttons then generate some plots. More info here in the future!\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nasdf\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated and maintained by @azylstra\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor support, please create an issue on GitHub and assign it to @azylstra","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
