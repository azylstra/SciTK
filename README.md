Java GUI toolkit for analytic applications

This goal of this library is to greatly simplify writing basic scientific-type applications. The toolkit provides functionality for most of the user interface, allowing you to write an application that focuses on the analysis and offload GUI work to SciTK.

Plots are created using the JFreeChart library, and are wrapped into windows with functionality for editing or saving the plot. A few varieties of dialog are available for getting input from the user. Some GUI elements are implemented into a template main window which can be extended for simple applications.
